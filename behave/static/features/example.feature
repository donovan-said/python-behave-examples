Feature: TEST WWW HTTP Endpoint

  In the following tests I want to ensure that when connecting to the www http endpoint:
  1) TBC
  2) TBC

  Background: APP WWW HTTP Endpoint Tests

  Scenario: APP WWW HTTP Endpoint - Accepted Request with TBC
    Given TBC "TBC"
    When TBC "TBC"
    Then TBC "TBC"

  Scenario: APP WWW HTTP Endpoint - Blocked Request without TBC
    Given TBC "TBC"
    When TBC "TBC"
    Then TBC "TBC"
